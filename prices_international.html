    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
December will be a challenging month for urea producers in many countries. A combination of drought, credit issues, additional supply and falling prices mean that buyers are postponing their purchases wherever possible and some demand is being destroyed.
Prices in Egypt slumped to $259/t fob – down $42/t in a month - as increased export supply has come onto the market for December. 
This has had repercussions for both Black Sea and Algerian urea, pulling Yuzhny urea prices down in Turkey and forcing Algerian urea to be sold outside its premium markets in Europe.
In the US, granular urea has sold as low as $222/st fob Nola, the lowest price since 2008-09 and equivalent to $222/t fob Middle East. This was $20-25/t below asking prices for spot cargoes in the Middle East, but probably indicative of things to come in 2016.
Suppliers in southeast Asia are struggling with low demand from Thailand, Australia and New Zealand and are cutting prices week-on-week to drum up some interest among buyers. Fob levels have dropped to $245-250/t fob without securing much new business.
But offers of granular urea, which has nowhere else to go, are expected to compete with the usual supply of prilled urea and pull prices down in China. Traders reason that, as this is likely to be the final chance to sell a large tonnage in India until March-April, suppliers will grab the tonnage and set prices later. After all, once the Indian business is complete, the market looks very empty.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
Mopco held a sales tender 25-26 November for 25,000t of granular urea for first half December shipment. It sold 6,000t cargoes to Yara and Agrium at $265/t fob and 20,000t to Keytrade at $259/t fob. It is reported to have a further 18,000t to export in December.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
Koch will load 40,000t of urea in Arzew in late November for Brazil. Sorfert is committed for December but AOA has product to place and has been in discussions with contract holders about possible destinations. West European demand appears adequately covered from Egypt, Russia, Sorfert and the Asian cargoes arriving, so further product may be offered into Asian and American countries.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Senegal</h4>
Nitron will load 25-30,000t of prilled urea in the Baltic in December for Dakar, understood to be for Toguna/Mali.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
Drought is affecting demand for urea and other fertilizers in the country and also in countries to the north. Apart from 25-30,000t of granular urea loading from Sabic for ETG and a Chinese cargo understood to be for Omnia, there is little urea moving to the region in December.



    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
The global phosphates market outlook remains bearish to the end of 2015 on a slowdown in seasonal demand, especially in south Asia, weak crop prices, and currency and credit uncertainty in Brazil. In addition, El Nino drought conditions have delayed business, particularly in Africa, and suppressed nutrient demand in India, possibly leading to heavy carry-over stocks. The only active markets of note are Europe, the US and Australia. Both the short and medium-term outlooks for phosphates are bearish. In the medium term, the decline in crop prices, a strong US dollar and the economic slowdown in China as well as new project start-ups will negatively impact the demand and supply balance.
The economic slowdown in China has forced the government to reduce state support for overblown industries, including the phosphates sector. This has led to higher domestic fertilizer prices, weighing on domestic demand, and a liberalization of trade policy. On the one hand the latter development is positive — allowing Chinese producers to remain competitive year round following the near-abolition of the high/low export tax window. But it has boosted supply enormously. China exported 6.39mn t of DAP in January- October, a rise of 82pc on the same period in 2014. Much of this growth has been driven by the rise in import demand in India, with China shipping 3.26mn t to India so far this year, a rise of 2.3mn t. But much of the growth in Indian demand has bypassed other producers. Jordan has been a particular casualty. Market reports indicate production problems at the Aqaba plant, but many speculate that Indian offshore demand has simply been lacking, or met by other suppliers.
Overall, market fundamentals are unlikely to support a real upswing in the near term. Crop prices are weak amid global oversupply and the El Nino effect has significantly dampened fertilizer demand, particularly in east Africa. This, combined with reports of financial issues, has delayed the opening of letters of credit in the recent Ethiopian NPS and other African tenders, which has hit OCP and PhosAgro shipments in the fourth quarter. The tonnage equates to 500,000t in total, and would have provided some support to producers at a traditionally lean time.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
OCP will load a 35,000-40,000t DAP cargo for China at the end of November under contract. Total DAP shipments to Europe have risen from 50,000t to 70,000t for November with latest sales reported in the mid- $460s/t fob. New sales have been reported in Romania and Italy.
There is still no opening of l/cs under the Ethiopian NPS tender that closed in September. OCP was in line to be one of the beneficiaries under any award along with PhosAgro of Russia.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
GCT is understood to have sold a total of 12,000t DAP to southern distributors in Turkey at $468/t fob Gabes.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Sudan</h4>
A 27,000t cargo of JPMC DAP is soon to load for shipment to Port Sudan covering an older sale.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Kenya/East Africa</h4>
DAP import demand, which should be kicking in now for December/January application, is distinctly lacking. Local sources report high inventories. Eastern and southern Africa have also been afflicted by currency issues and the El Nino effect.

    <br><br><br><br>

<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
The leading granular MOP markets of Brazil, US and Europe all saw softer spot prices in the last week of November, continuing the general falling price trend. European levels are being dragged downwards by France, as potential buyers remain absent from the market instead occupied with urea purchasing. In the US, it is a case of ample supply meeting lackluster demand. Certain sellers with barges on the river concede they will likely have to store them through winter now rather than chase prices lower. In Brazil, demand continues to disappoint pushing prices lower as sellers compete for business.
The benchmark Chinese 2016 contract remains a focus with suppliers hopeful that an early settlement will remove some pricing uncertainty. However, formal talks are yet to get started.
In the meantime, some suppliers may actively stop offering spot tonnes into certain markets because of the price levels on offer. This is already reported by some with reference to Brazil and west Europe. If this continues, it could see seller competition fall reducing the pressure on prices.
West Africa
Dole/Compagnie Fruitiere continues to discuss offers under its recent tender for 34,000t of fertilizers, including 1,800t of standard MOP and a small lot of SOP. The requirement is for cargoes to be delivered during the first half of 2016 to countries including Ghana, Cameroon, Senegal and Ivory Coast.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
OCP has started discussions with potash suppliers for its 2016 standard MOP needs, but has not called a tender. Discussions are ongoing for delivery during the first quarter or first half of the year. An indicative quantity of 100,000t has been mentioned, but in excess of this is likely to be required in the full year of 2016, OCP said. There is no firm time frame for the agreements, although some are likely to be settled by the year-end.
