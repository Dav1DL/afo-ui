<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
Spot prices in most regions had continued to ease. Willing buyers were hard to find and supply, in most origins, appeared ample. Buyers are aware of the weak overall sentiment and managed to achieve lower cfr purchases.
Outside of India, traders struggled to generate business East of Suez and offers were steadily sliding. Traders dropped offers into the high-$260s/t cfr to Thai buyers, before reports of a sale in the mid-$260s/t cfr which could not be confirmed. In China, suppliers were trying to keep sales under the IPL tender in India to above $260/t fob, but the demand outlook is weak and prices softened slightly. Granular urea traded as low as $260/t fob in China.
In the west, Brazilian trades have taken place at lower levels either side of $270/t cfr. In the US, barge prices have declined again despite improved buying activity. European buyers showed some interest, but were looking for below $300/t cfr in France and the equivalent in Spain.
The Black Sea is one of the few markets that showed relative stability towards the end of September. But this is largely due to short-term supply/demand issues with several plants currently down. The Baltic Sea has held steady with only small lots moving.
The global outlook remained weak with few sizeable demand outlets on the horizon. Weaker indications on the paper market are also adding to the bearish sentiment.


<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Ethiopia </h4>
The Ethiopian Agricultural Input Supply Enterprise (AISE) confirmed it has not yet issued awards under its 15 September NPS and granular urea tenders and was still evaluating offers.
The importer tendered for 400,000t of NPS and 200,000t of granular urea. The urea is for December 2015-March 2016 delivery in four lots. Agri-Commodities (backed by Sabic) and Trammo (backed by Fertil) were the only two suppliers to have submitted valid offers for the urea.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
Production rates continued to improve but nothing has been offered yet for export. Mopco is operating and Helwan was expected back up after the Eid holidays. Export cargoes are likely to be available for October.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
Helm had been checking freight from for 14,250-15,000t Arzew to Ghent and Brake for late September dates, and 20,000t from Arzew to Pasajes and La Pallice for similar loading dates. It is understood to have fixed both cargoes to cover existing business.

<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
The global phosphates market is all a bit gloomy with no uplift in prices expected in the near-term. This bearish sentiment is particularly strong west of Suez where prices have been softening in Latin America and the US in recent weeks with no signs of a revival any time soon. As a result, producers are attempting to at least stabilize pricing through production cuts.
This is perhaps best reflected in Mosaic’s announcement to "maintain planned slower production" for phosphates. No firm details were shared of the production curtailment but the company expects its phosphate sales volumes to be near the low end of its prior third quarter guidance range of 2.1mn-2.4mn t. This move had been widely expected for some weeks and underscores the fact that there is excess supply particularly west of Suez. Brazil’s woes with the Real and farmer credit are well known, but the US has been particularly disappointing, not just for US producers. Couple these developments with the natural slowdown in India and none of the major phosphate import markets are pulling product in differing directions, the fundamental phenomenon required to push prices up through competition. With India slowing, Chinese DAP producers are facing a difficult time. Saudi product, with no home in Ethiopia, is competing on the Indian subcontinent.
OCP had also confirmed that it will be tailoring output to demand through the fourth quarter due to lackluster demand west of Suez, most notably Brazil. The weakness in Brazil is reflected in OCP’s line-up with no new September sales to the Latin American country reported by the Moroccan producer. Any shipments in September to Brazil represent carryover from its August sales. Brazilian shipments for October look similarly improbable. OCP has also distanced itself from prospective shipments to the US in October. With a Chinese vessel in the line-up, the US domestic price is fragile, and traders were frankly reluctant to take any further risks. The OCP strategy is to reign in output, concentrate on phosphoric acid to India and NPKs to African markets.
Looking forward, there is little room for supplier optimism in Q4. Russian producers will see export availability rise in Q4 with the domestic season more or less over. It simply is not known how much production will be taken out of the supply chain in the US and Morocco. But seasonal slowdowns in the major markets and extra supply mean choppy waters ahead for suppliers.


<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
Tunisia's GCT is understood to have agreed 10,000t DAP with Gubretas under their supply contract at $495/t fob Gabes for September shipment.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Ethiopia</h4>
The Ethiopian Agricultural Input Supply Enterprise (AISE) tendered on 15 September for 400,000t of NPS comprising:
<ul>
    <li>200,000t of NPS + boron</li>
    <li>50,000t of NPS + zinc</li>
    <li>150,000t of 19-38-0+7S</li>
</ul>

<br><br><br><br>

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
The last week of September was fairly light on physical trade as the focus had been on broader market developments.
A supplier reported that Indian buyers were looking to renegotiate the price for the annual contract. The rupee is about 5pc weaker than when the contract was agreed in May, but it is likely that the main catalysts are the fall in global prices and the weak position of suppliers facing limited global demand. No information was available by time of going to press as to what price Indian buyers were seeking.
Prices west of Suez had slipped slightly. Deals in Brazil had been done as low as $295/t cfr, and Nola barges were assessed at $285-290/st fob. Brazil's real continued to depreciate, hitting 4.2/$ at press time. Credit risk continued to hamper business in Brazil and there was no sign of improvement in the near-term. The US is well-stocked with material, partially a result of offshore suppliers seeking a home for tonnes that were planned for Brazil; combined with limited demand this continues to pressure prices downwards.
East of Suez the markets are quiet. Sri Lanka's August tender for 25,000t bagged standard MOP for November delivery has now been officially awarded to Transmart, after Cabinet approval. Transmart offered at $326.12/t cfrfo Colombo. The tender season for Malaysian and Indonesian plantations is approaching, and in a rare spot of bullish news the crude palm oil price had firmed strongly - with futures reaching ringgits 2,200/t on the Bursa Malaysia today.
Generally speaking, the outlook is bearish for prices. The expectation was always for difficult negotiations over next year's Chinese contract, but with the Indian contract under pressure only a few months in this situation has deteriorated.


<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">East Africa</h4>
East African business continues, but mostly this is for small lots. APC was checking freight for a 10,000t cargo for shipment to Mozambique in late-August/early shipment. It is understood to have eventually moved smaller MOP quantities in containers.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
The South African rand has depreciated against the US dollar recently, but trade continues to be steady ex-warehouse. Granular MOP indications are around $345/t cfr.
ICL loaded 5,000-7,000t of granular MOP ex-Barcelona in September, for shipment to Nigeria. No prices were disclosed.
