    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
Over 650 delegates gathered in Cartagena, Colombia, for the Fertilizer Latin America conference, with a lot of discussion focused on when the downtrend in urea might end.
No concrete conclusions were drawn, but the market did begin to turn the week after the conference. Demand started to improve from a fear-affected low in January, although urea producers have yet to make any meaningful attempt to limit export supply.
Buyers in Latin America are beginning to line up urea for March shipment, with some still reluctant to tender, unsure whether urea prices will start to fall again. A purchase of granular in Brazil at $190/t cfr, netting to the low-$180s/t fob Middle East, marked the low point of the January slump.
Other regions in which sales took place saw more stable pricing. Egyptian producer Mopco sold 40,000t of granular urea at $224/t fob, $8/t down on previous Egyptian business. OPZ sold 20,000t of Yuzhny urea at $200/t fob for first half February, well above netbacks on earlier sales to Turkey. And Nola prices stabilized in the mid/high-$190s/st fob, before starting to rise.
The US is now attracting urea for February and March shipment, with low freight rates from China and the AG meaning that spot granular urea is workable for the US Gulf again. Algerian urea is also being discussed, although fob levels in North Africa need to fall somewhat to permit sales to the US.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
Mopco held a sales tender 27-28 January for 25,000t of granular urea for February shipment. It sold two lots of 18-20,000t to Agrium and Trammo at $224/t fob for shipment in the first half of February.
Prior to this, Alexfert sold 5,000t to Trammo at $226/t fob for prompt shipment to Italy.
OCI sold granular urea at an equivalent price, netted back from cfr sales in southern Europe.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
    Sorfert has restarted one ammonia and urea line, after technical issues forced a shutdown of an ammonia line. The other ammonia line remains down- Sorfert has been operating on one line since November.
Ameropa short-loaded the m/v Ekaterina with 11,420t of granular urea from AOA, as opposed to 25,000t planned, and sailed on 23 January to meet the scheduled arrival time in Romania after bad weather delayed loading.
AOA had a short interruption of production, but it is understood that production is running again on both urea units. Traders are checking freight for 25-30,000t cargoes to load from AOA’s plant in February for non-European destinations.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Benin</h4>
A tender closed for 10,000t of granular urea.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
Prices dropped dramatically in the last week of January. Both producers and traders, facing dreadful demand west and east of Suez, have been obliged to cut prices drastically to attempt to shift some tonnage. The price cuts have been most severe in North Africa, where OCP sold 20,000t DAP to Turkey at around $400/t fob, with only the weak freight clawing back some of the netback. This is $50/t below what OCP had been asking, and reflects the extraordinary disparity that had hitherto been apparent between European prices for phosphates and those in the rest of the world.
GTIS data reveal that China exported over 8mn t DAP in 2015, buoyed by increased Indian demand last year. That is roughly half of global DAP trade. The question now becomes at what point China begin to turn the export tap off in 2016. Breakeven costs for an integrated producer are around $330/t fob - perilously close to where prices are now in Latin America. In this scenario, potential Indian netbacks are considerably superior, even though cfr prices fell into the $380s/t cfr for fresh tonnage and demand is thin on high stocks.
Overall, the market looking forward is decidedly bearish. With prices dropping so far so fast, buyers will continue to stay out of the market for as long as possible. Fundamentally, the lack of Indian and Brazilian demand will continue to weigh on prices. No market is pulling in product in any meaningful amounts. Q1 will be painful for suppliers. Brazilian credit lines need to be restored and India needs to draw down stocks and announce its subsidy. The only possible upside is in the US, where barges actually firmed marginally. But there will be no shortage of supply with OCP agreeing two cargoes already with a trader and PhosAgro shipping in late Q1. Production cuts appear inevitable.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
OCP sold 20,000t DAP to Turkey at a price netting $400/t fob Jorf Lasfar or just above for early February shipment. It was discussing a 35,000t DAP cargo for an African market and will load two DAP/MAP panamaxes for Koch.


    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
GCT reported no new sales and had yet to firm its ideas for a February price. DAP production is running at 70-80pc.



    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
It was a slow end to January in terms of actual spot trading, with buyer caution prevailing in most instances. In some countries, spot prices were assessed unchanged but this was more a sign of the inactivity than market stability emerging.

In Brazil, spot prices moved lower, but many suppliers continued to talk of redirecting cargoes to other markets or simply cancelling shipments and stepping out of this spot market altogether for the time being. In the US, barge prices fell amid the ongoing lack of buying interest.

Suppliers are hopeful that the second half of 2016 will see better demand as by this time, both global benchmark contracts in China and India will likely have been settled.

The latest import statistics showed China imported a massive 9.4mn t of MOP in 2015, highlighting the importance of this outlet amid the market downturn. But high stocks, slow demand and falling domestic MOP prices are the main features of the Chinese market ahead of this year’s annual contract talks.



    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Moroco</h4>
OCP is yet to finalize any agreements regarding standard MOP procurement for 2016 and remains in talks with suppliers. A total quantity in excess of 100,000t is likely to be required for its NPK production during 2016.
