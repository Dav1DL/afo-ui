            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle"> NITROGEN</h4>
            Despite a relatively balanced market for February, urea prices are already coming under some pressure
            because of the bearish outlook from March onwards. Chinese granular urea prices started to weaken because
            domestic demand is drying up. US prices dipped below $320/st fob Nola - $14/st down on last week. Baltic
            prilled urea prices softened to $304-307/t fob due to lack of sale opportunities.

            Trade balances show an increasing surplus of urea on world markets as Q2 starts, particularly with China
            enjoying a lower export tax, and this is forecast to push fob levels down for March and April shipment. The
            paper market is showing Arabian Gulf granular urea below $310/t fob March-April. The gap between Chinese
            prilled and granular urea is also expected to shrink from the current $25-30/t to $10/t or less, implying a
            large fall for granular.

            The prices offered in the Indian tender this week were neither bullish or bearish. The netbacks from the
            lowest price is around $285/t fob China thanks to extremely low freight rates of $8-9/t for 60,000t cargoes
            to east coast India. This is not as high as the $290-295/t fob Chinese suppliers were targeting, but at
            least no trader shorted the market at aggressive levels below $280/t fob.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
            Exports of urea are likely to be a maximum of 30,000t in February and could be zero. A meeting took place
            yesterday between the Egyptian urea producers and the ministry of agriculture to discuss the ministry's
            request for all output to be delivered to the domestic market. The producers did not accede to its request,
            however. The production situation has improved over the past week, with more urea units operating and others
            due to restart imminently, but spot trade remains on-hold as domestic commitments are fulfilled.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Libya</h4>
            LifeCo is operating only its larger urea unit, producing about 50,000t/month of prills. It will load around
            15,000t for European markets and 17,000t for West Africa in January and is planning 18-20,000t for the US in
            early-February.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
            Sorfet has announced that export supply will be lower February-April due to requirements from the domestic
            market. It estimates that up to a third (approximately 35,000t/month at capacity) of its production will
            have to be distributed in Algeria.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle"> PHOSPHATE</h4>
            Producers for the most part are comfortable heading into February; Brazilian stocks are reportedly low and
            US domestic prices are edging up on limited local supply and sparse imports. OCP will have cargoes for the
            US in February, plus Ethiopia, and some tonnage to Europe as well as Latin America. The Russians have
            shipments fixed for Latin America while the lack of GCT tonnes will also be to the benefit of OCP as well as
            the Jordanians who are shipping to Europe and Australia. China is not interested in DAP exports and is
            concentrating on the domestic market. In the US, supply is snug. However, end user demand is low especially
            in Brazil (plus there is plenty of trader length on phosphates heading to Latin America) and Indian demand
            off-season is muted which could lead to a hiatus in activity at the end of Q1. The market is flat to
            slightly softer as a result.

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">
            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
            GCT is understood to have sold 10-12,000t of DAP to Italy in January at $510/t fob. February availability is
            still unclear but it is understood Tunisian production is running at very low levels. The Tunisian DAP price
            has been moved upwards notionally to be in line with the Moroccan DAP price and to reflect current
            theoretical netbacks. However, it is uncertain if GCT is currently offering any tonnes.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle"> Morocco</h4>
            European buyers believe OCP may have sold as much as 50,000t DAP for January shipment to European markets
            including Benelux, France and Italy. Importers concur $530-535/t fob is achievable following on from OCP's
            reported sales last week at this level. The producer is heavily committed for February with NPS headed to
            Ethiopia, plus a heavy baseload of DAP and MAP for the US. Exports to Latin America are comparatively thin.
            OCP will bring on line its 1mn t/year granulation facility for the African market at the end of Q1.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
            An interesting estimate to come out of the PotashCorp presentation of its Q4 and annual 2014 results is that
            global shipments were around 61 mn tonnes MOP in 2014. Last year expectations started off at around 56-58 mn
            then moved upwards to 57-59mn then 58-60 mn and then to 60 mn. A final figure of 61 mn, if proved correct,
            would reflect substantial growth. Part of it was due to buyers in the second half of 2013 deferring their
            purchases while prices were tumbling following the split by Uralkali from BPC.

            This could mean that 2015 will not match 2014's figure but this might not necessarily be the case. Two major
            markets, Brazil and India look set to match or exceed 2014. India's imports turned back up in 2014 and are
            expected to increase further in 2015, while Brazil is expected to match 2014's record imports. The US market
            may also be close or, at worst, be only slightly down.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Ethiopia</h4>
            The biggest tender yet closes for this market on 30 January. It calls for 33,011t granular MOP to be shipped
            in Feb/Mar. It can
            all be shipped in one cargo apparently.

            It may very well be part of Ethiopia's new ATA (Agricultural Tranformation Agency) initiative and the
            blending program. The Yargus Nectar blending and bagging system is currently operational in Ethiopia.
            Delegates to the Argus FMB Africa conference in Addis Ababa 18-20 February can sign up to visit the plant on
            17 February, the day before the conference starts.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
            According to the South African Revenue Service, MOP imports in January-November 2013 were 19pcs higher than
            2013, up 51,000t. Chile remains the largest supplier, with deliveries stable with the previous year. SQM has
            operations in South Africa as part of its joint venture with Roullier, SQM VITAS.
