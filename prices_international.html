            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
            Urea prices ended 2016 on a strong note and in some places at their highest level of the year. While the
            Christmas and New Year holiday slowed activity, the few sales that took place all saw increased prices and
            the outlook was optimistic for January.
            Granular urea supply was tight in Asia. Chinese exports shrunk to 330-340,000t/month in October and November
            and are unlikely to rise in Q1 2017. For calendar 2016, it is likely that Chinese urea exports fell by more
            than 5mn tonnes compared to 2015, doing much to bring supply and demand back into equilibrium.
            In the West, Brazilian buying switched off at the end of December, purchasing for the safrinha season coming
            to an end and attention became fully focused on the US. Granular urea prices moved up again in the US Gulf
            and were equivalent to $265/t cfr for February arrival, lagging spot prices in the AG by $5-10/t.
            Reduced supply of prilled urea from Ukraine has tightened supply in the Black Sea and has obliged Turkish
            buyers to look at alternative sources. Iranian, Egyptian and, possibly, Baltic urea will move to cover
            requirements for January.
            Despite the current firm market, looking at average prices for the year as a whole, it is evident that 2016
            was a disappointing time for the urea industry. Fob prices in the Arabian Gulf, Egypt and the US Gulf fell
            by about $80/t compared to 2015, averaging $206/t fob, $216/t fob and $206/st fob respectively. 2016 was the
            fourth successive year of falling prices:

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">EGYPT</h4>
            A couple of additional sales took place the fourth week of December. OCI sold 30,000t of granular urea for
            December shipment to the US at $273/t cfr. Freight from Damietta to Nola for 30,000t was put at $18-19/t,
            suggesting a netback in the mid- $250s/t fob.
            Prior to this, Mopco sold 10,000t of granular urea to a trader at $255/t fob for January shipment, which was
            followed by a 15,000t sale on 22 December at $261/t fob, also for January shipment.
            Egyptian producers were still trying to reach agreement with the ministry of agriculture on a formula under
            which urea would be priced for domestic deliveries January-April.
            In the interim, producers were to start delivering some urea to the local market from the last week of
            December. While in principle the government could take up to 55pc of production, it was expected output from
            the country’s seven export-oriented urea plants would be split roughly one-third for the domestic market and
            two-thirds for export. This should permit exports of 200-220,000t/month in January.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">ALGERIA</h4>
            Ameropa was in the freight market for 30,000t of granular urea to load in Arzew prompt for the US Gulf.
            Freight ideas were around $19/t. It loaded one 30,000t cargo from AOA for Spain in December and another for
            the US.
            AOA invited bids for granular urea for January loading by close of business on 24 December for award on 25
            December. Sorfert loaded about 35,000t of granular urea in December but was now concentrating on domestic
            sales, selling about 1,500t/day into the local market and reported better prices than for export. It sold
            for export in earlier December based on a formula price of Egypt fob + $6/t.


            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NIGERIA</h4>
            Trammo bought 30,000t of granular urea from Indorama at a price in the low-$240s/t fob for mid-January
            loading. Prior to this, Keytrade was to load 30,000t of granular urea for Brazil 28-30 December.
            Indorama was not offering at present because it might have to close its Port Harcourt plant for 30 days from
            mid-January for turnaround.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">BENIN</h4>
            The Association Interprofessionnelle de Coton (AIC) issued a tender, closing on 5 January, for the following
            products:
            Urea – 40,000t
            NPK 14-18-18+6S+1B – 100,000t
            NPK 13-17-17+6S+5B+1.5Zn - 25,000t

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
            Liquidity was scarce but prices stable-to-firm in a month dominated by announcements from Mosaic which were
            set to impact the global phosphates market. In Europe, Moroccan and Russian producers were seeking to
            increase DAP prices but there were no new sales. In Latin America, sellers were attempting to hold prices as
            Eurochem reported new sales into Brazil. The US market continued its mild resurgence in the fourth week of
            December with Mosaic reporting DAP sales at $305/st fob Nola but the heavy import line-up in January looked
            set to prevent prices from rising too high. The consensus from traders was that international prices were
            bottoming out as India remained quiet despite the subsidy rollover.
            American producer Mosaic confirmed its much-rumoured acquisition of Brazil-based Vale’s fertilizer assets
            for $2.5bn as it continues to expand into South America. The deal involves the purchase of phosphate rock
            mines in Brazil, as well as chemical and fertilizer manufacturing plants with a nameplate capacity of 4.8mn
            t/yr of finished phosphates. Meanwhile, Acron confirmed its plans to diversify into MAP and DAP production-
            which is expected to reach 600,000t – 900,000t/yr capacity. Both these announcements highlight producers’
            preference towards vertical integration and diversification on the supply-side. The Vale deal is Mosaic’s
            latest shift away from its domestic market following the 2013 announcement of its 25pc stake in the $7bn
            Wa’ad Al Shamal joint-venture with Sabic and Ma’aden.
            On the subcontinent, Indian demand was suppressed by increasingly high Chinese offers and DAP stocks of over
            1mn t. Deepak scrapped its tender as prices were deemed too expensive- reportedly at $330/t fob ex-China;
            the Blue Deebaj and IPL demand was yet to be met as Chinese producers refuse to give way on prices. Stocks
            fell almost 400,000t over the month but remained high at just above 1mn t, offering Indian buyers some slack
            in the face of tight Chinese supply.
            In China, operating rates were reported to be below 60pc nationwide following the consensus reached amongst
            producers in the third week of December at the Guiyang meeting. Seasonal domestic demand was still
            lacklustre but offer prices rose. This means producers had little interest in exporting DAP/MAP. Producers
            were offering DAP at $320-330/t fob to the international market but had been achieving sales of as high as
            $340/t fob equivalent in the domestic market. As home demand was expected to remain strong until March, a
            price reduction is unlikely in 1Q 2017 even if there is a cut in export duty.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">MOROCCO</h4>
            OCP made no new sales since the third week of December with discussions ongoing for January. As with Russian
            producers, OCP was pushing for a $10-15/t increase on DAP prices into Europe for January loading. January
            availability remains tight given that two more NPS vessels were expected to load for Ethiopia (100,000t) and
            a rolling turnaround was taking place. At this stage OCP said it may not load any DAP/MAP for Brazil in
            January

            10,000t would move domestically. End- December was to see a TSP vessel also loading for Bangladesh under

            were no TSP sales to European destinations.

            Awarding of the Kenyan DAP tender remained opaque with some suppliers reportedly receiving notification of
            orders for NP/NPK and DAP for the tender but not the final contracts. No volume had been specified. It was
            unclear whether other potential suppliers also received these notifications.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
            The market remained steady in the fourth week of December, leaving participants in no doubt that the period
            since August has been the most stable of the year. Few sales were reported in the last week in December,
            although indications were that suppliers are bullish heading into 2017, and will seek to capitalise on the
            price momentum over the past few months.
            Suppliers were targeting $245-250/t cfr for granular MOP in Brazil, and €245-255/t cfr for granular MOP

            in Europe from January. And North American producers raised offers to $265/st fot Corn Belt in the US. But
            the $240/t cfr offers for standard MOP in southeast Asia did not appear to be rising at this stage. Buyers
            will resist the increases, particularly in some western European countries that suffered from poor crop
            yields and harvests.
            Expectations are for a quiet start to 2017. The market awaits the start of Chinese consortium negotiations,
            expected soon after Chinese New Year.

            But 2017 will see the start-up of the 1.4mn t/yr Turkmenkhimiya mine in Turkmenistan, the 2.86mn t/yr Legacy
            mine and an extra 900,000 t/yr from a third site at Esterhazy — both in Saskatchewan, Canada — as well as
            Eurochem’s 3.7mn t/yr Usolskiy and 4.6mn t/yr Volgakaliy projects in Russia. With so much new capacity
            coming onstream, it is difficult to see how prices will remain stable in a market that is already
            oversupplied.
