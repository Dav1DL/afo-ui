    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
    Urea prices ended the year about 25pc lower than they started. Increased export supply, which will be a major feature of the market in 2016, outweighed any increases in demand and pushed prices down especially in the second half.
    Average prices for Arabian Gulf granular urea fell to $281/t fob for 2015 from $330/t fob in 2016. Yuzhny average prices were $273/t fob down from $319/t in 2014. This is the fourth successive year of decrease since 2011. And the likelihood is that 2016 will be the fifth.
    Apart from Yuzhny, which now only accounts for 100-150,000t/month of export supply, prices dropped in all areas during the last reporting week of December and are still declining for January. Activity was limited by the run up to the Christmas and New Year holidays, but the business that has taken place has been at lower prices.
    The US Gulf market hit a seven-year low at $218/st fob Nola. A 50,000t cargo of Qatari granular urea has been diverted to Turkey because of lack of demand from Latin American markets. This is probably a portent of things to come in 2016, when AG producers will have to find alternative markets for some of their US shipments.
    Inventories are starting to mount in China. Port inventories are estimated at over 700,000t after allowing for the quantity still to be loaded for India. There is no obvious market for this urea and traders are already short selling against China for January.
    There is always a chance that this will be overdone, but at present offers in regional tenders in Asia are seeing offers below $230/t fob China. In South Korea, in the annual NACF tender, one company sold prilled urea at a price equating to $220/t cfr. The urea is for delivery in the first half of 2016.
    2016 will be a tough year for urea producers, with prices expected to reach levels not seen since 2005-06 and some already questioning whether prices will fall below $200/t fob.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
    Sorfert has a full programme of exports for January and has agreed a price formula for its January sales to traders of Egypt fob + $8/t, which has been accepted by some trading companies.
    Helm is loading 21,000t of granular urea in Arzew this week for shipment to Ghent, Belgium. Ameropa has 22,500t loading for Italy. Trammo will load 10,000t for Tarragona, Spain, and 6,000t for Sevilla, Spain. Helm will also load 6,000t for Sevilla. Trammo will load 22,000t for Bordeaux and La Pallice, France.



    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Ethiopia</h4>
    AISE asked for a further extension of offer validity to 25 December under its 5 November tender for 228,000t of urea.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
    Congestion and loading delays at Egyptian ports meant that producers were not in a position to offer more urea for sale. Twenty-nine vessels were waiting at anchorage at Damietta on 17 December, with loading delays estimated at 8-9 days.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
    Trade had been lackluster in December as the market drew towards the holidays west of Suez. Trade activity had been limited to a Saudi sale of DAP/MAP to Latin America under formula, a Chinese DAP/MAP 10-50 sale to Australia at $403/t fob and 40,000-45,000t of Lifosa DAP was reported to have sold to Europe at $455-465/t cfr. The price of the European sales raised a few eyebrows as European prices look to have rebounded slightly with offers now within this range as suppliers anticipate a pick-up in demand early 2016.
    The global phosphates market ended the year on a bearish note – a wild difference from the firming market witnessed the same time last year. Prices largely remained stable amid sluggish trade in the run up to the holiday season west of Suez.
    Sentiment remained undoubtedly weak and bearish fundamentals appeared set to follow the market into the New Year. A market rebound is unlikely before the second quarter, when Indian demand returns and Brazil steps in for Safrinha. The market is oversupplied with Europe and Australia expected to be the key outlets during the first quarter. There is still some African demand to be met. Ethiopia’s AISE awarded its second tender for NPS with 95,000t for OCP. Burkina Faso’s Sofitex also awarded its 100,000t NPK tender. This has helped relieve some pressure on the supply side. Some market players also hope for more US demand to emerge as the spring application approaches but there are already several cargoes lined up for the US from Russia and Morocco in early 2016. Moreover, soft US domestic prices do not make the market an attractive outlet.

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
    OCP was continuing to negotiate additional sales to Europe but reports that any new sales will now be for January shipment due to a lack of availability for December. It estimated its December DAP/MAP European shipments will be around 70,000-75,000t rather than the allocated 80,000-90,000t.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
    A couple of short-lived strikes at the Gafsa mine and on the railways did not seem to have hampered production more than normal and output was running at about 50pc of capacity. Overall, GCT was projected to process 3.2mn t rock in 2015, but is targeting 6mn t in 2016. It’s confident railway transportation issues will improve thanks to investment promised by the government in the railway system.





    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
    The global potash market ended the year on a bearish footing. Most potential spot markets had been slow and there were few signs of sizeable spot demand re-emerging in the short-term. In terms of market prices, contract shipments provided better netbacks than spot as the latter fell steadily for much of the year 2015. A comparison with the end of 2014 made grim reading for spot sellers:
    <ul type=”disc”>
        <li>Northwest Europe granular MOP cfr, down around 3pc (but down nearer 14pc in US dollar terms because of the euro depreciation)</li>
        <li>Brazil granular MOP cfr, down approximately 29pc</li>
        <li>Southeast Asia standard MOP cfr, down by around 15pc</li>
        <li>US Nola fob barge price, down by around 35pc</li>
    </ul>
    In some cases, we were back to price levels last seen in 2007. But it is important to provide some context as potash cannot be viewed in isolation to the general commodity markets trend. Other fertilizers have seen similar declines. For example, Egyptian granular urea prices fell over 25pc year-on-year. Crop market developments play a significant part in farm-level sentiment/buying and French milling wheat futures were down around 9pc year-on-year, while US corn futures were down approximately 8pc. Meanwhile, Brent crude oil lost over 40pc during 2015, reaching an 11-year low in late December.

    Currency depreciations also contributed to the lower potash buying and weaker sentiment with the Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah, Brazilian real and Malaysian ringgit seeing notable falls against the US dollar over the past twelve months, adding to importers’ costs.

    The oversupply of MOP was a theme of the fourth quarter. In late December, Agrium announced it had completed a successful proving run of its expanded Vanscoy potash mine in Saskatchewan, Canada establishing the plant's new nameplate capacity at over 3mn t/yr MOP.

    Looking ahead to 2016, the 2mn t/yr K+S Legacy project in Saskatchewan is expected to start production, but some MOP production has been taken out or will be soon, from the likes of PotashCorp at Penobsquis in Canada and ICL winding down its MOP operations at Boulby in the UK.
    The outlook for the global potash market is uncertain at best. Contract settlements in China and India will help provide some clarity for nervous spot buyers, but it is not clear exactly when these will be agreed. In the meantime, spot buying will likely remain cautious and prices under downwards pressure.




    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">West Africa</h4>
    Talks continued between various sellers and Dole/Compagnie Fruitiere under its recent tender for 34,000t of fertilizers, including 1,800t of standard MOP and a small lot of SOP. The requirement is for cargoes to be delivered during the first half of 2016 to countries including Ghana, Cameroon, Senegal and Ivory Coast.
