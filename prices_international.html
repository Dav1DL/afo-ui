            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
            The firm stance adopted by Chinese urea producers has been given a boost by the early announcement of a new tender in India. Chinese prilled urea prices have risen above $290/t fob in May and about $10/t higher for granular.
Seeing the higher prices in China, traders have gone shopping elsewhere. Middle East prices were initial beneficiaries. Traders have booked granular urea in the $305-310/t fob range for June; May is already sold out.
The higher prices are slowly being realized in cfr sales in major markets. Buyers are reeling from the rapid rebound in prices since early April, and from the reversal of the anticipated glut of Chinese urea for May.
A glut is unlikely to develop in May given the demand from India, however, and firm prices should be maintained through May and into June, but concern over the rest of Q3 remains given rising supply.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
Any hope of Egyptian exports in the short-term has again been dashed by the chronic shortage of natural gas. A lack of gas supply forced Alexfert and Mopco to shut down their urea units on 27 April. No restart date has been confirmed. EFC is also currently down but hopes to restart in the coming days. Helwan restarted on 30 April, following a shutdown lasting 48 hours.
            
            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
            Sorfert loaded a total of 84,000t of granular urea for export in April. For May, the line is as follows: OFT 5,500t on the m/v Deltadeip; 4,000t on the m/v Veendeip and 20,000t on the m/v Filitsa and 4,500t on the m/v Delawarediep. Indagro also load 4,500t on the m/v Manuela E and 6,000t on the m/v Satigny.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">East Africa</h4>
            Avignon will load a 25,000t cargo in the Middle East in mid-May for Beira and Nacala, based on a formula price.

			<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>            
            A trader has sold 30,000t of Omani granular urea for May shipment to Durban and Beira in the high- $290s/t cfr with credit. Freight from Sohar is put at around $20/t.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
            Sentiment in the market remains upbeat with another round of price increases for MAP in Brazil while DAP prices are stable as India continues to buy.
Following a sharp rebound in Latin American prices in the third week of April, traders continued to purchase Russian MAP for this region. Russian MAP sold at $465-475/t fob in the last week of April for Latin America shipment, which is up $5-15/t on prices at the beginning of the month. Such levels imply a cfr equivalent of $485-495/t Brazil.
Almost 1mn t of DAP has been booked for May arrival in India and heavy buying is almost certain to continue through the next few months with total DAP deliveries for the April-June period estimated to reach 2.2mn t versus 500,000t during the same period last year. While the Chinese and Saudis will likely mop up the majority of the business there, it seems that almost everyone with the exception of the Moroccans would like a piece of it. Mosaic has already lined up four panamaxes to India while an additional two PhosAgro DAP vessels have been agreed bringing total Russian DAP shipments to India for Q2 to five.
Looking forward, producers appear to be comfortable in the near term. The Russians have scheduled turnarounds in May and are sold out through to early June. The Moroccans have a May line-up totaling 365,000-375,000t DAP/MAP/NPKs while Sabic also reports to be sold out for May. The domestic season in China has been extended until mid-May keeping producers busy. These factors, alongside improved Latin American demand, consistent Indian buying and an impending 600,000t DAP/TSP Bangladeshi tender, should help support prices in the coming weeks.

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">
            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
OCP reports the sale of 60,000t of MAP to multiple buyers in Brazil at a netback price around $480/t fob.
The producer says it has around 20,000-30,000t of MAP available for Brazil for May shipment and has raised its asking price to $500/cfr, which would provide a mid/high $480s/t fob netback.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
            GCT is understood to have sold 10,000t of DAP to Gubretas in Turkey for March shipment. Its production is estimated at 50-60pc of capacity.


            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">West Africa</h4>
BPC has disclosed that it has booked 7,000t granular MOP to be shipped to an undisclosed market in West Africa. It expects to also book some container loads to this region. 

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Est Africa</h4>
Another source has confirmed last week’s report that granular prices were around $370-380/t cfr. However it added that this was not the case for all suppliers, K+S Kali is quoting closer to $400/t cfr.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
Demand is still very low in this market. It is the quiet season until June and the drought has also affected offtake. SQM is offering granular MOP out of its warehouse at prices equivalent to $370-380/t cfr and is looking to raise prices for the second half.
