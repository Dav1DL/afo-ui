<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
Despite a relatively balanced market on paper for September, urea prices are trending lower and optimism is in short supply. Currency depreciations in several major import markets are keeping demand for urea below normal levels for September.
This has begun to put pressure on prices and, while falls in physical urea are few, paper markets are heading in only one direction – lower.
In fact, the physical sales during the last week of August showed little decrease in price: Fertil reported a granular urea sale at $293/t fob AG, up $10/t on last done; Grodno sold prilled urea at the equivalent of $268/t fob, up $4-5/t on last done; Yuzhny traded unchanged at $267-272/t fob; Chinese prills were $2-3/t softer at $272-273/t fob.
Barring an upturn in demand, though, these price levels will be difficult to sustain through September. Paper market trades at $290/t cfr in Brazil and offers at $274/t fob AG for September are pointing the way prices are going.
Support from the US market has disappeared and prices there are now no better than $275/t fob AG for granular urea. Europe is short of granular urea until production resumes in Egypt and Algeria and could provide an outlet for AG producers, but prices need to fall to the low-$270s/t fob before cargoes become workable.
China took a back seat because the large demand for India and Pakistan is covered for the time being. Attention will switch East when the next Indian tender is announced and Chinese fobs become the focus once again. Traders are likely to test the $270/t fob level in China for September cargoes.
One upside to the currency turmoil towards the end of August was the jump in the euro against the US dollar, which prompted some buying of UAN solutions and granular urea in Western Europe. Traders were able to offer lower euro prices while maintaining unchanged dollar prices. Some €7-8/t were shaved off UAN prices in France, while granular urea offers dipped to €290-292/t fca.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Ethiopia </h4>
The delivery schedule for AISE’s 15 September tender for 200,000t of granular urea is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Lot 1 - 2 x 25,000t for arrival by 3 December 2015 in Djibouti</li>
<li>Lot 2 – 2 x 25,000t for arrival by 29 December 2015 in Port Sudan</li>
<li>Lot 3 – 2 x 25,000t for arrival by 23 January 2016 in Djibouti</li>
<li>Lot 4 – 2 x 25,000t for arrival by 3 March 2016 in Djibouti</li>
</ul>
<br />
AISE plans to tender again in December to supplement the quantity purchased under its 15 September tender.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
AOA is producing urea on one line at its complex. It has confirmed loading dates to traders from urea previously allocated for September but is not offering any new tonnage for September shipment.
AOA expects to continue to alternate production between the two urea lines at the site near Arzew up to the end of 2015 before the plants can be handed over by the contractor.
Sorfert completed loading 25,000t for Koch and three 4-5,000t vessels for Helm. All the cargoes are being shipped to France.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
Alexfert has sold 4,000t of granular urea at $295/t fob for prompt shipment. The buyer is reported to be Topic, an Egyptian trader, possibly for shipment to Greece. The price has been excluded from our assessment because it is below the minimum quantity specified. Mopco sold 2,000t to OFT at a reported price around $295/t fob for September shipment.
Production at all of the major urea exporters remains down. Talks continue between the government and the urea producers regarding the price they pay for natural gas. A price rise is likely because of the higher cost of imported LNG required to meet domestic demand.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Ivory Coast</h4>
Helm is checking freight for 20,000t of prilled urea for September shipment to Abidjan. A tender in Mali has been awarded recently and traders are starting to cover the fertilizer needed.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
Potash buyers are largely opting to wait and see amid the current overriding economic uncertainty. The potash market is not immune to the wider global financial concerns with currency depreciations and stock market volatility among the major talking points.
August is seasonally a slow period for many countries including those in Europe and the US, but traditional low trading has been compounded by the current weak sentiment and outlook. The net result is that buyers are very nervous. With no sign of prices rising in the short term, buyers are content to take a pause. As a result, spot price levels remained largely untested by the end of August.
In this environment, suppliers focused on shipping cargoes under existing business/contracts. Traders and suppliers spoke of minimal spot trade, with most business confined to small lots. Among the few trades heards BPC and Uralkali report selling MOP to Vietnam.
India, Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia all faced issues which gave the current demand outlook a bearish tone. The depreciation of the Indian rupee has led some to predict lower MOP imports in September.
Brazil remains shrouded in financial uncertainty, while Indonesia and Malaysia face currency depreciations and falling crude palm oil prices.
The forward looking statements releases highlight the weak outlook. Uralkali expects lower potash demand this year across most markets, including India, south-east Asia and Brazil. It forecasts total 2015 potash demand to be 58mn t, down from 63mn t in 2014. SQM also expects lower global MOP demand in 2015 when compared with 2014, and talked of possible upcoming pricing pressure.
The considerable depreciation of the rupee makes it difficult for importers like NFL to make a decision on the current tender. September imports are also likely to be lower as a result.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
GCT has sold 15,000t DAP to Italy, understood to be for late August/early September shipment, at $505/t fob.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
OCP is reportedly offering $500/t fob for September shipment to France on DAP. It reports the sale of an additional 50,000t MAP to Brazil for 1H September shipment. In a slight reschedule to the August line up, all three phosphate vessels for the US will have loaded in August or early September. 
For September, the extra 50,000t to Brazil apart, there are no additional sales. Allocations comprise 150,000-200,000t for the US/Latin America, 100,000t for Europe and 80,000t for Africa.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
BPC reports continued container shipments into Durban, with granular material offered at $350/t cfr. Other suppliers are heard offering at $340-350/t cfr.
