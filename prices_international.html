<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
STC of India secured 850,000t of urea under its 19 June tender at prices about $17/t higher than the previous inquiry. The most striking feature of the tender was the wider range of origins. Rather than just China and Iran, traders sold urea from the AG, Black Sea and Baltic.
Activity was limited outside India. The Brazilian market remained an enigma. It appeared that insufficient urea had been purchased for July arrival, but depressed conditions in the agricultural sector meant that there is little justification to buy more. Some AG granular urea had been sold at $315/t cfr on a fixed price basis for July, although vessels that arrived in June had been priced higher on a formula basis.
International prices are expected to remain firm through July, given the tight supply from most sources, but August and September are likely to see some pressure mounting, especially on granular urea. Where they can, buyers will defer purchasing urea until later in Q3 in the hope of seeing lower fob levels.


<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria </h4>
Nitron loaded 15,850t of granular for North America from Sorfert. Koch fixed the m/v Lucky Trader to load 21,300t of granular urea in Arzew in late-June for the UK and loaded the m/v SDS wind with 7,000t for France.


<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
Urea production went into reverse again amid the continued lack of gas supply. The short-term outlook is poor, but suppliers are hopeful production will stabilize in September when demand from the power sector traditionally declines.


<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Nigeria</h4>
Inquiries for urea for July shipment started to emerge, with the requirement estimated at up 2-3 x 20,000t cargoes. This demand was yet to firm up, however, and July is late to ship urea to Nigeria for application in the 2015 cropping season.


</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
OCP and its Indian JV partners settled the phosphoric acid price up $5/t to $810/t P2O5 cfr for 2H 2015. This speedy settlement will provide OCP with more options, given the uncertainty over Brazil, where weak demand had resulted in another slide in MAP offer prices, down $5/t to $490/t cfr. Moreover, OCP had no Brazil shipments lined up in July – usually a peak import month for the country – which perhaps provides one of the strongest indications of the lack of Brazilian demand. Elsewhere, India is understood to have booked another 105,000t DAP with additional inquiries/tenders announced for another 115,000t DAP. Pakistan has purchased two more cargoes in the mid/high-$480s/t cfr.
<br>
Looking beyond July, when most producers look comfortable, Indian demand will keep Saudi, Jordanian and Chinese producers occupied. The concern is Brazil. The bullish argument runs that Brazil will step in, for no other reason than ‘it has to’. True, Brazilian MAP imports are running way behind schedule, and with Chinese 11-44 MAP shipments likely to lessen as Q3 progresses due to a narrowing shipment period to Brazil, then 11-52 and 12-52 looks to be the MAP of choice. But any upside looks likely to be limited and brief. Markets need momentum to gather pace. Many argue that we have reached the peak of the price escalation already. At the same time, the US is not exactly the most attractive of the destination markets currently given stagnating domestic pricing, hence shipments there are unlikely to be major.


<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
OCP reports to be sold out for July with Turkey set to take around 40pc of its total NPK/DAP/MAP output. The producer had indicated that it will not ship any DAP/MAP to the US or Brazil next month as it is fully committed for July. This also reflects the lack of demand in Brazil due to poor credit availability and weak crop pricing.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
The state of production at GCT is still opaque. Latest reports indicate that production at Gabes and Skhira is at least partially down due to strikes now taking place at the production facility as workers ask for additional benefits, even though phosphate rock from the mines is flowing again. The lack of output may be one factor in Turkish buyers’ incentive to buy from OCP.


<br><br><br><br>

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
PotashCorp has submitted an offer to acquire all of K+S shares, according to K+S. Any deal would be subject to conditions – due diligence on the part of PotashCorp, agreement by shareholders (likely to be influenced by the directors of K+S) and very likely some scrutiny by the European Commission.
K+S said that it is assessing it options.
There have been reports in Russian press that Uralkali’s major shareholders are considering taking the company private, and possibly merging with Uralchem. This has not been confirmed by Uralkali, however, the board of directors is to convene a shareholder meeting on 7 August 2015 to vote on “a major related-party transaction” and has charged its audit committee to “evaluate the benefits” of listing Uralkali’s depositary receipts on the London Stock Exchange. There is therefore potential for some significant changes in the corporate landscape, though it is too early to predict the effect on pricing.
Elsewhere, SQM has released a statement in response to the allegations made by Corfo off-record to Chilean newspapers; 
In Brazil, suppliers are still pushing for an increase to $340/t cfr for July shipment but without making much headway. BPC reports that it has sold 60,000t at $340/t cfr for July, but this could not be verified by press time.
In India, ICL has officially stated that it has agreed terms with customers for 835,000t MOP (including options) over the 2015/16 contract period.



<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
Uralkali shipped 10,000t standard MOP to OCP against contract in June.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Senegal</h4>
Uralkali shipped 10,000t standard MOP to this market in June.
