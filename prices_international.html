            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
            The bears are out in the urea market this week as prices continue to fall as supply outstrips demand. The
            only stable price is prills in China – which is only really supported thanks to traders needing to cover
            about 130,000t of shorts in India against the old MMTC tender and the fact that the Chinese domestic season
            is kicking in after New Year. After mid-March, support here may also weaken.

            The US domestic has taken something of a battering. Barge prices have slipped to around $290/st fob,
            compared to $303-315/st last week and the outlook for April is worse. Heavy 2H 2014 imports and decent
            logistics all mean supply is plentiful. Elsewhere west of Suez, cfr prices in Mexico and Brazil have slipped
            from the $320s/t cfr to as low as $300/t cfr for granular. Brazil is off season and there are plenty of
            vessels booked from the Arabia Gulf for February and March. Netbacks from Brazil into the Arabia Gulf would
            be $285-290/t fob.
            Egyptian production is down again, with all four of the main producers reportedly ceasing production once
            again due to gas supply issues. However, European demand remains muted. There is no demand in Germany. Italy
            is beset by poor weather and an overload of supply, France has no real need for urea before April and Spain
            is waiting for the second application to begin.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
            Sorfert today reported that its urea unit had stopped on 25 February because of a technical problem. No
            further details, including the nature or expected duration of the shutdown, were closed.
            Indagro is currently loading 18,700t on the m/v Sakarya. Among upcoming scheduled loadings, OFT is expected
            to load 3,300t on the m/v Abis Bergen, 5,300t on the m/v Wilson Malo and 4,500t on the m/v Abis Dundee.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Nigeria</h4>
            A trader is seeking a vessel for 10-12,000t of granular urea to load in Onne spot/prompt for Bordeaux/La
            Pallice/Bayonne and seeking options for Uruguay and Rio Grande, Brazil.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle"> South Africa</h4>
            South Africa imported a record 905,143t of urea in 2014, up 45pc year-on-year, according to statistics from
            the South African Revenue Service via GTIS. China raised its deliveries to 236,000t from 15,000t in 2013 to
            become the largest supplier, followed by Qatar with 235,000t (down 11pc) and Saudi Arabia with 207,000t (up
            22pc).


            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
            India remains in the spotlight as demand continues to gather momentum with close to 500,000t DAP now booked
            for Q1 arrival. This improved Indian demand has helped Chinese producers return from the Lunar New Year
            holidays in a bullish mood with the price of Chinese DAP already showing signs of moving up to the
            mid-$480s/t cfr India, reflecting the mid/high-$470s/t fob. Chinese suppliers are now offering
            mid/high-$480s/t cfr minimum.

            In the meantime, a bearish sentiment remains in the west. European demand will likely come to an end by the
            end of March while slowdown in the US domestic market has also started due to cold weather conditions.

            On the upside, heavy buying is expected from India in the next couple of months given its low inventory and
            this increased demand, coupled with more buyer interest out of Pakistan from March onwards. This will
            provide support to the market if Latin America prices continue to wane during this period. It should also be
            noted that some of OCP’s JV partners are actively purchasing DAP, which could indicate that a settlement of
            the Q1 phosphoric acid price may still be some way off yet, placing more pressure on Indian buyers.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
            GCT’s DAP production has reportedly improved and is now understood to be operating at around 50-60pc
            capacity. It is not currently offering into Turkey and is focusing on fulfilling its commitments to Italy.


        </div>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
            It is understood that a trader will lift 25,000t of MAP from Foskor in March for Latin America, dismissing
            rumours that the South African cargo was for Australia.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
            OCP’s first post-panamax has loaded for the US and a second vessel will load in early March.


            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>

            The potash market is still waiting for a significant benchmark for 2015 prices. A settlement soon in China
            or maybe India is hoped for by many suppliers and buyers. There had been hopes that China would agree a new
            price before the Chinese New Year break but this did not materialise.
            Talks should start again in earnest and there have been suggestions that India might make the opportunity to
            step in first as it might secure a better price then. However, India only seems ready to book if there is a
            roll over, which suppliers are long way from being ready to concede. They point to the loss of 1.5-2.0 mn
            tonnes MOP from the flooding of Uralkali’s Solikamsk-2 mine, plus another reduction from the strike in
            Israel of up to 650,000t if it is out of action for two months. Buyers could argue that the capacity
            increases elsewhere counter-balance such losses.
            The above are mainly standard MOP markets. Granular MOP had been in tighter supply over 2014 and the start
            of 2015. Prices are still high in the US market but have softened slightly this year. This week information
            is emerging that pressure to sell in Brazil, the other major market in the Americas, has increased with one
            or more suppliers offering prices said to be at least $10/t below our assessment of $360-370/t cfr this
            week. Other suppliers are resisting this cut and it remains to be seen whether this is a temporary
            phenomenon.
            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle"> Ethiopia</h4>
            As expected the AISE tender for 33,011t granular MOP was awarded to Ameropa with BPC product, which offered
            at $408.25/t cfr liner out in Ethiopian Shipping vessels. Other bids came from ACL with APC product at
            $411.00, Indagro with ICL/DSW product at $414.44 and Yara with Uralkali product at $427.80 all on the same
            basis. MidGulf and Witraco also offered BPC product at a higher price.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
            The season for buying MOP has come to an end. Demand during 2014 was at a good level but the drought in the
            northwest of the country is likely to depress demand in 2015. In some areas it has been so bad that farmers
            are not harvesting the maize but just sending their cattle onto the fields to eat what they can.
            The prices for granular MOP have been relatively stable in this market with a number of sources putting them
            in the range of $380-390/t cfr and some narrowing it further to $385-390/t.

            <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">East Africa</h4>
            The prices for granular MOP to markets in this region are a little higher than for South Africa due mainly
            to the increased shipping costs. According to one source granular MOP ranges between $390-400/t cfr bulk
            while bagged product would be $20-30/t extra. The differential for the standard MOP is rather more stable
            and is typically priced at around $370/t cfr.
