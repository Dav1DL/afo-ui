    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
    Awards in MMTC of India’s amounted to about 970,000t by the time offer validity expired on 29 September. Traders sold more than 450,000t of Iranian urea, three cargoes from the AG totalling 120-130,000t, 60,000t from Egypt, with the balance to come from China.
    Prices agreed were $203.20-203.81/t cfr, some $9/t above the last Indian tender and equivalent to $194-195/t fob Middle East and $193-194/t fob China. Margins for traders were very thin, amounting to little more than $1/t in some cases. While the tonnage secured was large, it was not seen as sufficiently large to prompt a rally in prices.
    Anyone seeking spot tonnage in the Middle East for October will doubtless be faced with offers towards $200/t fob and similar levels from Chinese suppliers. Perhaps more important in terms of price development is the increase in coal prices in China that has pushed up production costs there. The floor level for Chinese urea was likely to edge up in early October because production costs at coal-based factories (the majority) rose by around $10/t. Suppliers resisted strongly selling below $195/t fob to India and the resistance point was likely to move up to $200/t fob in the near future.
    Prices moved up in Brazil. Sales of granular urea took place at $210/t cfr in the last week of September and the lowest offer saw was $208/t cfr. Most suppliers were indicating $212- 215/t cfr for October shipments. Although there was a heavy line-up of vessels loading for Brazil in September – estimated at more than 400,000t – a large proportion of the urea was to cover forward sales made some weeks ago, limiting the amount of urea for new offers.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">ALGERIA</h4>
    AOA held a sales tender on 27 September for 30,000t of granular urea for October shipment. Ameropa bought 30,000t for Ireland at $196/t fob and Koch 20-30,000t for Europe at the same price. Sorfert agreed to several cargoes for October loading but was yet to agree on a price as negotiations continued over the premium to Egypt fob. The previous premium was $3/t and Sorfert was expected to at least maintain this.
    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">EGYPT</h4>
    Producers have sold out quickly for October as traders scrambled to buy urea over the last two weeks of September. Argus calculated that more than 400,000t of urea were sold by the four main exporters for end-September and October shipment. Some 160,000t were moving to India and Brazil, while traders have also covered short sales made in Western Europe and Black Sea markets. Mopco sold a total of 240,000t of granular urea for end-September and October loading: 120,000t on 22 September at $191/t fob; 40,000t on 23 September at $192-193/t fob; and about 80,000t on 26 September at $195/t fob. The most recent sales were to Ameropa (20,000t), Trammo (20,000t), Helm (12,000t) and OCI (25,000t). Abu Qir closed a sales tender on 29 September for 20,000t for second half October shipment, which may be the last sizeable lot available from Egypt for September. It sold the whole quantity to Dreymoor at $197/t fob.
    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">TANZANIA</h4>
    An inquiry was circulating for 10,000t of urea and 10,000t of DAP.</div>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 afo-notes">

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
        Traders sold short in Asia at prices reflecting sub- $310/t fob DAP China. Producers were resisting thanks to slow production rates and winter storage programmes. East of Suez, latest awards and offers in Pakistan and Nepal respectively suggested Chinese DAP prices were heading south of $310/t fob but based on traders shorts and producers were resisting. Pakistan bought sub-$325/t cfr, which marks Indian prices notionally even lower. Pakistan imports were now well over 900,000t, suggesting another 100,000-150,000t to book.

        The strength of Indian demand in 4Q was key. For now it was stymied by fears over a revised subsidy (which looks unlikely) and expectations of a cut in the MRP (more likely but extremely complicated) possibly at the start of 2017. Given the erosion in cfr values, further cuts were possible to bolster consumption and still maintained importer margins. High stocks (some estimated 2.6mn t plus a heap of NPKs) and concerns over a patchy monsoon were at play. On paper India needed at least another 1mn t DAP in 4Q but that number was open to question and estimates were more around 800,000t with the October line up pretty thin. There was simply no incentive to step in currently. Domestic production was pumping out DAP on cheaper ammonia and phosacid for 4Q. This posed a major problem for Chinese and Saudi producers going forward.

        Saudi Arabia needed a surge in Indian demand to soak up supply in October or get back into what demand remained in Pakistan or east Africa. Russian producers faced a slowdown in regional markets. Indeed it was reported that PhosAgro sold DAP and NPKs to India in the last week of September. West of Suez MAP prices in Brazil came off a tad into the low/mid-$350s/t cfr on latest sales and offers. Trader length on MAP however looked limited.
<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">MOROCCO</h4>
        OCP reported that it overcommitted phosphate sales for September - overall shipments were 735,000t including three panamaxes for the US of 55,000t - versus an actual production rate of around 580,000t in September. As a result, 150,000t or so would be carried over into October's line up. In addition, the following sales have been made for October shipment:
<!--<b>OCP Morocco August commitments ('000t)</b>-->
<ul>
    <li>150,000t Brazil mainly involving MAP plus some NPKs with the MAP sold essentially at $355-358/t cfr rollover</li>
    <li>100,000t DAP/MAP to European markets</li>
    <li>130,000t to Africa including MAP to Mali for NPK manufacture plus shipments to Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Ghana</li>
    <li>70,000t to domestic market</li>
    <li>TOTAL: 450,000t</li>
</ul>

        Allowing for the 150,000t of carryover, this equates to an October commitment of 600,000t approximately. OCP looked set to garner the lion's share of the various awards in the Ethiopian NPS tender that closed on 22 September. Total awards was likely to amount to 532,000t.

    <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">TUNISIA</h4>
        Production problems caused by demonstrations in Gafsa stifling rock supplies reared their head again in the last week of September, which led to some production curtailments. The issues were resolved and one plant remained in shutdown. The second plant had a production plan of 40,000-50,000t in October but this remains rock dependent. September commitments comprise the cargo for Italy around 15,000t for Gubretas under contract in Turkey. Output for October would be prioritised for the Turkish market with some cargoes also under negotiation in European destinations. It was thought the Tunisian target price remained around $350/t fob but no deals for October have been concluded.
        <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">KENYA</h4>
        The Kenya Ministry of Agriculture postponed its tender for 40,000t DAP from 22 September to 4-5 October. At presstime there was still no award.
        <h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
        The potash market remained quiet in southeast Asia, Europe and Brazil. MOP prices were unchanged in all three regions. But US Fob Nola barge prices declined to $210-215/st on limited trade in the last week of September, from $215-220/st the previous week.
        TFI took place in San Diego at the end of September, and the market was focused on the outlook for the fourth quarter. Many expected a slight increase in MOP demand across the globe, and for prices to increase in Brazil, the US, and parts of southeast Asia.
        Europe remained in the doldrums, and expectations were for flat prices, whilst concerns over potash demand because of poor crop yields remained.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">AFRICA</h4>
        SQM said it will invest approximately $20mn in Elemental Minerals in exchange for 17pc of the company. The agreement also gives SQM the right of first approval for approximately 20pc of the total potash produced that will be produced by Elemental, the primary assets of which are a variety of potassium deposits in Congo (Brazzaville). SQM said the primary targets for the potash produced at Elemental's Congolese sites will be the African and Brazilian markets. The State General Reserve Fund of Oman and Summit Private Equity will invest $20mn and $10mn in Elemental, respectively, according to SQM.        <br><br><br><br>
