<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
<br>An Indian tender set for 30 October had propped up prices in China and the rare event of a sale above $300/t fob had lit up the market from Egypt. Both reinforce the view that the market is firm for November, but there is no confidence that the rally in price will extend much beyond first half December.
<br>STC was expected to buy up to 1m tonnes of urea under its tender. To achieve that, it needed prices to be acceptable to Chinese suppliers – above $250/t fob - and hope that there were no over aggressive offers from traders that would limit sales.
<br>It also remains to be seen whether the jump in price follows through into higher cfr/fca levels in European markets. The situation is complicated. On the one hand, the linkage with Algerian fob levels will oblige traders to push for higher prices in European markets to pass on the increase in cost. But on the other hand, traders are still covering short sales made at fixed prices, so may lack the ability to pass on the increase. The euro is also going through one of its weak phases, which does not help.
<br>Once the Indian tender is concluded and the round of buying for Europe is over, the urea market looks less healthy. Chinese suppliers have resisted selling below $250/t fob yet again, but conditions in Q1 2016 will challenge that level. More regular exports from Egypt and consistent production from the three urea plants now operating in Algeria will also change the import picture in Europe.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>
Mopco invited bids on 28 October for 9,000t +/- 10pc of granular urea for prompt shipment. It finalised the sale of 2 x 9,000t on 29 October at an impressive $301/t fob, the high price bringing forth a second lot. Ameropa bought one cargo, a shy buyer took the other. Yara and Agrium were
both rumoured to have bid for it. 
The new Mopco 1 granular urea plant (660,000t/y capacity) was brought into production this week, so that Mopco now has two plants operating. Mopco 2 is also ready to produce if gas is made available.
Helwan is expected to tender next, offering 10,000t of granular urea for first half November shipment. 
OCI is shipping around 14,000t of EFC urea to Bulgaria in late-October/early-November to cover existing sales. 
Alexfert remains closed due to a lack of gas.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
The market received an unlikely boost in the last week of October with 135,000t DAP booked into Pakistan, all variously reported in the low/high-$430s/t cfr for Chinese and Saudi product. The catalyst had been the PRs500/50kg price drop to the farmer as a result of the imposition of a government subsidy. Fob levels have eroded further on the back of this, with Chinese DAP hovering around $420/t fob on this and reported business into India, where cfr levels fell into the mid-$430s/t cfr from $440/t cfr although trade remained very thin.
Otherwise the market remained painfully quiet. Despite rumours of business in Australia, actual confirmation had not been forthcoming. Saudi and Mexican product was under discussion there but no concrete sales were confirmed. Likewise, in Ethiopia there were no reported developments on l/cs.
Brazil saw no liquidity with rumours of lower prices at $430/t cfr for MAP traded. Several traders reported US material on offer in east coast Mexico, suggesting lower Tampa levels for DAP around $430/t fob.
In Europe, there was scant activity. Around 10,000t Euro- Chem DAP was reportedly sold into Germany at $495/t fca, although as October progressed reports surfaced of sales/ offers in the $480s/t fca.
The US domestic market also trended lower with DAP barges assessed at $415-425/st fob Nola.
Overall the market outlook remains bearish through Q4 on heavy Indian stocks and the lack of demand in Brazil. Australia will eventually provide some relief but competition will be fierce. Further European demand should also show itself as November progresses. The US will also provide an outlet for Russian and Moroccan DAP/MAP.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
Last GCT sales done for Italy were at $485/t fob although a trader reported lifting some product $10/t lower also for shipment to the Mediterranean. Currently, GCT shipped about 20,000t/month to Italy. On TSP, GCT asked $400/t fob.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Ethiopia</h4>
There was no progress on l/cs under the last NPS tender in September and the 50,000t NPS +Zn tender was under re-evaluation at press time. A fresh tender closed on 5 November for 81,000t NPS.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
OCP categorically denied reports linking it with a vessel of phosphates for the US, stating that it will not ship anything to the US in October and a November cargo is also unlikely. An NPS cargo to Ethiopia was delayed due to l/cs yet to be opened under the September tender. OCP is scheduled to be awarded substantial NPK business in various tenders in west coast Africa. Generally, OCP continued to granulate less, and concentrate on phosphoric acid sales to India.


<br><br><br><br>

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
Imbalanced supply/demand continued to weigh on sentiment across the major potash markets with spot prices edging down in many countries. The short-term outlook remains weak and buyers are keen to wait and see, in an attempt to catch the bottom of the market. 
At a major industry event in Barcelona, Spain, the mood remained flat with buyers across the region yet to step in for their next requirements. Domestic stocks are considered to be far from ample, suggesting buyers will need to purchase before the end of the year to replenish, but as yet, they are content to pause. Granular MOP prices have edged down to €285-290/t cfr in Benelux markets amid this lacklustre demand – back to price levels seen at the start of 2015.
Southeast Asia standard MOP prices have dipped to a low of $300/t cfr on latest reported business in Malaysia and Indonesia by the end of October. Unconfirmed reports of trades below this continued to circulate, but were unconfirmed. This level will be further tested in the current round of plantation tenders.
Looking ahead, producers’ reluctance to accept lower spot prices will continue to be challenged unless spot demand in the major markets improves in the short-term.
On the contract markets, China remains a valuable outlet for suppliers considering the slack spot activity. Vessels continue to be nominated for India, but the pace has slowed and optional tonnages will not be taken up. Initial European standard MOP contracts for the fourth quarter have started to be reported at a rollover from the third quarter, but talks were still ongoing in some instances.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Burkina Faso</h4>
Burkina Faso's La Societe Burkinabe des Fibres Textiles (Sofitex) closed a tender on 15 October. Requested was various fertilizers including 2,500t of MOP.
