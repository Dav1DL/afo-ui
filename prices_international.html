<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">NITROGEN</h4>
Much discussions took place but little clarity was gained during the IFA Conference in Istanbul. The prevailing view is that urea prices are firm through June into July, but that the scope for further increases in price is limited. Prices are expected to turn down at some stage in the second half of 2015 as export supply increases from new factories and from China. But the surprising strength of prices in China in Q2 means that most observers are cautious about when or indeed if this will happen.
The Pakistani tenders on 29 May and 1 June were expected to confirm Chinese prilled urea prices above $300/t fob from north China. Deliveries of urea to the ports was running at only 10-12,000t/day, equivalent to 300-360,000t/month; exports in April were over 800,000t, so the market is in no danger of being overburdened in the short term.
Brazil has become the main focus of the urea trade in the West. Suppliers and buyers are wide apart on price for June shipments, however, and offers at $330-335/t cfr are about $15/t above bids. Depending on which side prevails, prices could netback to either $312-315/t fob Arabian Gulf or $300-305/t fob.
<br />In Europe, Yara issued its new season price for CAN 27 in Germany, the leading benchmark for nitrates, at E225/t cif inland showing a small fall over June 2014. The price is seen as competitive with current granular urea prices and is likely to be accepted by distributors.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">East/South Africa </h4>
Innofert has bought 25,000t of prilled urea from Keytrade for May loading in the Baltic for Beira, Mozambique, at a price in the high- $320s/t cfr with 180 days' credit.
Several granular urea cargoes will load in the Middle East in June for East and Southern Africa. Avignon has 25,000t moving from Saudi Arabia in May, ETG 25,000t from Saudi in June. Gavilon is shipping a Fertil cargo to South Africa and Koch and Omani vessel for Omnia.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Libya</h4>
Lifeco is producing at capacity on the larger of its two urea units, equivalent to 1,800t/day. Yara has just completed 10,000t for Egypt, sold 20,000t to Toros, Turkey and loaded around 20,000t for the US in early-June.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Algeria</h4>
The breakdown at Sorfert has led to the cancellation of early-June cargoes planned for OCI and Indargro. The plant is expected to be down until early-June.
AOA completed loading 12,000t of granular urea for Trammo/Italy last week. Ameropa began to load 30,000t of urea for Brazil. Freight to Brazil was indicated at $12-13/t.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Egypt</h4>            
OCI bought 3,000t of granular urea from Mopco at $320/t fob. Koch purchased a 3,000t from Alexfert late last week at $317/t fob and HFC reported 3,000t sold at 321/t fob. Traders are seeking prompt urea cargoes to cover tonnage affected by the force majeure declaration in Algeria. The cargo sizes are below the minimum threshold for our methodology but are considered representative of the prevailing price for Egyptian urea given limited export supply.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">PHOSPHATE</h4>
The global phosphate market remains steady at best as market players gathered in Istanbul. Sentiment overall is for limited upside basis some Brazilian demand re-emerging coupled with further imports into India. Many suppliers expressed desire not to push prices up too far too fast. Others believe this a tactic to keep 
Chinese MAP for Brazil would be too late. Whilst trade activity has been relatively limited in most regions, ironically, Turkish importers have started to step into the market purchasing Jordanian and Egyptian DAP while Toros agreed a 50,000-100,000t DAP/NPK supply deal with OCP. 
Elsewhere, reports of deals have been few. In the east, unconfirmed reports indicate that India purchased a DAP cargo in the low-$480s/t cfr but otherwise Indian demand is still slow. However, at press-time PhosAgro confirmed a 1.35mn t three-year deal with IPL India for DAP/NPS/NPK. Thailand took Chinese DAP at a netback of around $460/t fob. In Latin America, Brazilian MAP prices are pegged around $495-500/t cfr. On TSP, a trader has reportedly taken Moroccan TSP at $392-400/t fob for Europe but Moroccan TSP is understood to have achieved as high as $400/t cfr in Brazil.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Morocco</h4>
It is understood that OCP will begin shipping phosphates to Turkey's Toros in June under a 50,000-100,000t DAP/NPK supply agreement.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Tunisia</h4>
GCT is still thought to be shipping a 18,000-20,000t DAP to Gubretas Turkey under the frame agreement. It is not certain whether this was from stocks.
<br>Production of finished fertilizers at GCT sites has not yet resumed and the market awaits the results of negotiation between the Tunis government and protestors, expected later this week or early next week. Production of fertilizers stopped following strike action in the main rock producing region of Gafsa, which halted train supplies of phosphate rock from Gafsa to DAP/TSP production facilities. Inventory of phosphate rock at the finished fertilizer production site is low.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
Trader were understood to be inquiring for a Saudi MAP cargo for June shipment. At press time there were reports of at least one, if not two cargoes, having been sold. Further details were sketchy.

<br><br><br><br>

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">POTASH</h4>
At the IFA conference, it was generally conceded that little or no potash business was concluded as is often the case. One Indian buyer took a spot cargo because his normal contract supplier could not ship enough in time. It also emerged that prior to the conference Canpotex had booked another 15,000t granular MOP to Brazil at $340-345/t cfr to add to the 30,000t already done for June shipment. During the exchange of views between suppliers and buyers it was increasingly clear that standard MOP supplies were tight now that suppliers had the contract commitments to China and India in full swing. Granular MOP on the other hand was not under pressure as offtake from both Brazil and the US were down on last year. In 2014 it had been the other way around, granular tight and standard freely available.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">Israel</h4>
It is understood that negotiations on a settle of the strike and ICL's Dead Sea Works plant are underway in earnest and it is hoped that there be a resolution. How soon not fully clear.
<br>ICL has some MOP stocks, so shipments to China will begin immediately the strike is over and then also to India once the contracts are settled. The price established by other suppliers is already clear but what volumes will be agreed remains to be seen. ICL has already lost around 1 million tonnes and fresh production will take some time to build up again. Over the balance of 2015 it is hoped that part of the lost production can be made up by running the plant at high capacity.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">South Africa</h4>
Suppliers and buyers were generally in agreement that application will be boosted in the second half of 2015, in order to make up for the drought losses in the first half. As result demand in 2015 will end up pretty similar to that in 2014.

<h4 class="afo-page-subtitle">East Africa</h4>
Granular prices were around $370-380/t cf in this region, although K+S Kali is reported to be quoting closer to $400/t cfr.
