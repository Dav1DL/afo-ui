    "subtitle": "<em>September 23-24 2014</em> | Entebbe, Uganda</p>",
    "text": "CountrySTAT Uganda, in collaboration with the AfricaFertilizer.org (AFO) initiative, held a two-day joint Fertilizer Technical Working sub-Group training and validation workshop that equipped 18 participants from public and private sector agriculture and statistics institutions with hands-on training in the AFO and CountrySTAT data platforms. The two-day training familiarized participants with the CountrySTAT and AfricaFertilizer.org initiative and procedures on fertilizer data cleaning and processing in accordance with AFO guidelines. Participants worked with Uganda’s 2012 national fertilizer data as sample data and learned how to handle and clean raw data, how to generate fertilizer volumes and values in products and nutrients, and how to complete CountrySTAT and FAO tables for publishing. Practical group sessions reinforced the participants’ new skills and ensured opportunities for troubleshoot and linking the data collection and processing with stakeholder experiences. Participants were also guided through pre-validation of Uganda’s 2013 fertilizer statistics, the production of the CountrySTAT output tables and the Fertilizer Resource Utilization Account (FRUA) questionnaire. Key Highlights:<ul> <li>The training gathered valuable insights and perspectives from the public and private sector stakeholders to continue to tailor and improve the CountrySTAT and AFO platforms. During the validation process, participants noted that the data on volumes of some fertilizers were low compared to those recorded by the importers, cited the need to review this data, and the importer stakeholders agreed to provide their trade statistics to rectify the information. </li> <li>Border post inspectors with the Ministry of Agriculture highlighted the continued challenge of tracking importation of NPKs, as some NPKs imported did not have their formulations indicated. The agents attributed this to the importers lacking permits to import these fertilizers. </li> <li>The participants agreed on the future participation of additional stakeholders in pre-validation workshops, including more private sector operators and border post officials, to enable more interaction and coordination between private and public sectors stakeholders. </li> </ul>"

    "text": "CountrySTAT and AfricaFertilizer.org (AFO) have partnered in Ghana since 2012 and set up a national fertilizer technical working group (FTWG). The April workshop brought together 17 participants from Ghana and Nigeria FTWGs and the AFO team for a two-day fertilizer data processing training and one-day workshop. The workshop and training were organized with support from USAID/West Africa. In the two-day training, participants learned the AFO methodology and steps for processing raw data, with each building a solid understanding of the data processing technology. The participants then had a practical session with sample data. Using 2013 raw data from Ghana Customs Service, participants learned how to interpret data using Microsoft Excel tools such as pivot tables, and how to fill out tables of information on CountrySTAT and FRUA/FAO platforms. As part of the one-day validation workshop, participants reviewed and confirmed data from 2009 to 2013 on Ghana’s fertilizer production, imports and exports and consumption. Key Highlights:<ul> <li>Nigeria FTWG team members gained firsthand experience on how the CountrySTAT Ghana FTWG team collects, processes, validates and updates their fertilizer statistics, providing critical insights in the management of their own country data. </li> <li>The participants discussed the AFO initiative as a provider of better indicators/benchmarks that can be used by the AU and other similar organizations in the formulation of its targets for Africa and the need to improve farmers’ access and increased use of fertilizer. CountrySTAT program was a project, scheduled to come to an end in December 2014. The main idea behind it was, once initiated, government was to take over the program and run it like a national body. </li> <li>Both the Ghana and Nigeria FTWG’s recognized their need to finalize their respective fertilizer product catalogs to share with the larger group for use in the cleaning and processing of raw trade data. </li> <li>A tour of the CountrySTAT websites for Ghana and Nigeria was conducted and suggestions made on documents that needed to be uploaded on the respective websites. </li> <li>Identified concrete means of promoting CountrySTAT and its work to the wider public, via social media, news bulletins and public appearances on agricultural radio programs. </li> </ul>"
